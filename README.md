# DON'T BE A DUMMY PUBLIC LICENSE [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20me%20a%20tree-%F0%9F%8C%B3-lightgreen)](https://offset.earth/philsturgeon)

As developers we all want to protect our code from dummies that try to steal, sell, infringe or just generally rip us off. For this we have licenses like GPL, MIT, etc.

Sometimes however, you release a project where you just don't care what happens to the code. For this Sam Hocevar created the [WTFPL] which is a brilliant license.

For those of you who want something in between, try the [DBAD license].

[DBAD license]: LICENSE.md
